In addition to having a discussion list, a blog aggregator, Slack, an IRC channel, an electronic journal, and an annual conference, people independently decided that it might be nice to meet in person more than once a year to talk about stuff they are working on...and to hang out and drink {beverage_of_choice} with fun & knowledgeable people. A list of local chapters is available on the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Main_Page#Local_.2F_Regional_Groups">code4lib wiki</a>.
