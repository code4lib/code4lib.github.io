The Code4Lib Conference Planning Group is calling for
proposals to host the 2013 Code4Lib Conference.  Information on the
kind of venue we seek and the delineation of responsibilities between
the host organization and the Planning Group can be found at the
conference hosting web page [1] and on the Code4Lib Wiki [2].

The deadline for proposals is Sunday January 22, 2012. The
decision will be made over the course of the following weeks by a
popular vote.  Voting will begin on or around Wednesday January 25,
2012 and will continue through the first three days of Code4Lib 2012 until
11:59PM Pacific on Wednesday, February 8th. The results of the vote will be
announced on Thursday, February 9th, the final day of Code4Lib 2012.
You can apply by making your pitch to the Code4Lib Conference Planning
list [3]; attention to the criteria listed on the conference hosting
page is appreciated.  May the best site win!

Feel free to take a look at the winning proposal from 2012
