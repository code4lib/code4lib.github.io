Code4Lib 2015 is a loosely-structured conference that provides people working at the intersection of libraries/archives/museums/cultural heritage and technology with a chance to share ideas, be inspired, and forge collaborations. For more information about the Code4Lib community, please visit [http://code4lib.org/about/](http://code4lib.org/about/).

The conference will be held at the Portland Hilton & Executive Tower in Portland, Oregon, from February 9-12, 2015.

**Proposals for Prepared Talks:**

We encourage everyone to propose a talk. 

Prepared talks are 20 minutes (including setup and questions), and should focus on one or more of the following areas:

* Projects you've worked on which incorporate innovative implementation of existing technologies and/or development of new software
* Tools and technologies – How to get the most out of existing tools, standards and protocols (and ideas on how to make them better)
* Technical issues - Big issues in library technology that should be addressed or better understood
* Relevant non-technical issues – Concerns of interest to the Code4Lib community which are not strictly technical in nature, e.g. collaboration, diversity, organizational challenges, etc.

**To Propose a Talk**

* Log in to the Code4Lib wiki and edit the [Prepared Talk wiki page](http://wiki.code4lib.org/2015_Prepared_Talk_Proposals) using the prescribed format. If you are not already registered, follow the instructions to do so.

* Provide a title and brief (500 words or fewer) description of your proposed talk.

* If you so choose, you may also indicate when, if ever, you have presented at a prior Code4Lib conference. This information is completely optional, but it may assist voters in opening the conference to new presenters.

As in past years, the Code4Lib community will vote on proposals that they would like to see included in the program. The top 10 proposals are guaranteed a slot at the conference. The Program Committee will curate the remainder of the program in an effort to ensure diversity in program content and presenters.  Community votes will, of course, still weigh heavily in these decisions.

Presenters whose proposals are selected for inclusion in the program will be guaranteed an opportunity to register for the conference. The standard conference registration fee will still apply.

Proposals can be submitted through **Friday, November 7, 2014 at 5pm PST (GMT−8)**. Voting will start on November 11, 2014 and continue through November 25, 2014. The URL to submit votes will be announced on the Code4Lib website and mailing list and will require an active code4lib.org account to participate. 

The final list of presentations will be announced in early- to mid-December.
