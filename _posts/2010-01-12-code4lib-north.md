Announcing a new chapter: <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/North">Code4Lib North</a>, for people in Ontario, Quebec, and nearby regions of the United States. 

A number of people from these places run into each other at Code4Lib, Access, and the Ontario Library Association and other conferences, or through work with the Ontario Council of University Libraries, or just in general geek circles.  Now we can plan to get together in true Code4Lib style! There is talk about a possible meet in Kingston in the spring. Kingston is convenient for people from the Golden Horseshoe, Ottawa, Montreal, Qu√©bec, and upstate New York.  

Anyone interested in being in the chapter can put their name down on the wiki page. There's no mailing list yet, but we'll make one when we need one. In the meantime we can discuss things on the main code4lib mailing list.
