Libraries are not neutral repositories of knowledge. Library
classification systems and search technologies tend to reflect the
inequalities, biases, ethnocentrism, and power imbalances of the
societies in which they are built [1]. How might we better resist these
tendencies in the library software we create? This talk will examine
some qualities of feminist HCI (pluralism, self-disclosure,
participation, ecology, advocacy, and embodiment) [2] through the lens
of library software.
