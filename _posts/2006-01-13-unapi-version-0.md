Attached is the first version of the unAPI spec.  Excerpting:

        <p>"unAPI is a simple website <span class="caps">API</span> convention.  There are many wonderful APIs and protocols for syndicating, searching, and harvesting content from diverse services on the web.  They're all <strong>great</strong>, and they're all already <strong>widely used</strong>, but they're all <strong>different</strong>.  We want <strong>one <span class="caps">API</span></strong> for the most basic operations necessary to perform simple clipboard-copy functions across all sites.  We also want this <span class="caps">API</span> to be able to be easily layered on top of other well-known APIs."</p>

And:

        <p>"The objective of unAPI is to enable web sites with <span class="caps">HTML</span> interfaces to information-rich objects to simultaneously publish richly structured metadata for those objects, or those objects themselves, in a predictable and consistent way for machine processing."</p>

This specification is being developed under the <a href="http://curtis.med.yale.edu/dchud/log/project/rogue/announcing-rogue-05">ROGUE 05</a> process.  The next revision, revision 1, is due on Thursday, 16 Feb 2006, and is dependent on at least three working implementations to move forward.  That date is also day 2 of <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2006">code4lib 2006</a>; I will be speaking about unAPI on day 1, and hopefully we'll have a breakout session following up the talk which will be a great time to discuss the spec, to try implementing it, and to work on revision 1 for release the next day. :)

We are tracking milestones, notes, and document revisions within a private basecamp project, but interested parties are welcome to participate (contact me for access).

The list of record for unAPI development is the <a href="http://cipolo.med.yale.edu/mailman/listinfo/gcs-pcs-list">gcs-pcs-list</a>.  Please send questions/comments/implementation feedback there.

[Update (2005-05-21)]: Please note that the official unAPI site now lives at <a href="http://unapi.info/">unapi.info</a>.
