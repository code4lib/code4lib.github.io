title: Visualizing Library Resources as Networks
created: 1390335846

Matt Miller, New York Public Library, NYPL Labs.

Library resources are typically presented linearly in the form of a catalog search results page or an iterative list of subjects, books, special collections, etc. This talk explores the possibilities created when thinking of library resources as interconnected networks. We will look at the progress of a project to visualize NYPL resources such as catalog subject headings[1][2] as a network. We will also look at moving beyond visualizations into building network interfaces, such as our archival access term explorer[3] prototype.
