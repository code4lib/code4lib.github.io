Based on the success of the <a href="http://www.dml.indiana.edu/">Variations</a> digital music platform, Indiana University and Northwestern University have developed a next generation educational tool for delivering multimedia resources to the classroom. The Avalon Media System (formerly Variations on Video) supports the ingest, media processing, management, and access-controlled delivery of library-managed video and audio collections. To do so, the system draws on several existing, mature, open source technologies:
<ul>
<li>The ingest, search, and discovery functionality of the Hydra framework</li>
<li>The powerful multimedia workflow management features of Opencast Matterhorn</li>
<li>The flexible Engage audio/video player</li>
<li>The streaming capabilities of both Red5 Media Server (open source) and Adobe Flash Media Server (proprietary)</li>
</ul>

Extensive customization options are built into the framework for tailoring the application to the needs of a specific institution.

Our goal is to create an open platform that can be used by other institutions to serve the needs of the academic community. Release 1 is planned for a late February launch with future versions released every couple of months following.
