The deadline for proposing a talk has been extended one week to Jan. 9. We've already got several very cool proposals but more is better, and there's plenty of room for spillover in the lightning sessions and breakouts.

To submit, <a href="/conference/2006">read this first</a> and then follow <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/proposals">these instructions</a>. Especially the 75-words-max part.
