Since only one proposal was submitted to host Code4Lib 2012, and no other proposals were known to be in the works, and the one proposal was a strong one, by popular acclaim the <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/code4lib2012seattle/">Seattle proposal to host Code4Lib 2012</a> was accepted. Congratulations to the Seattle team, and we'll see you next year!
