Call for Proposals (and apologies for cross-posting): 
 
The Code4Lib Journal (C4LJ) exists to foster community and share information among those interested in the intersection of libraries, technology, and the future. 
 
We are now accepting proposals for publication in our 18th issue. Don't miss out on this opportunity to share your ideas and experiences. To be included in the 18th issue, which is scheduled for publication in October 2012, please submit articles, abstracts, or proposals at http://journal.code4lib.org/submit-proposal or to journal@code4lib.org by Friday, June 29, 2012.  When submitting, please include the title or subject of the proposal in the subject line of the email message. 
 
C4LJ encourages creativity and flexibility, and the editors welcome submissions across a broad variety of topics that support the mission of the journal. Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
 
* Practical applications of library technology (both actual and hypothetical)
* Technology projects (failed, successful, or proposed), including how they were done and challenges faced
* Case studies
* Best practices
* Reviews
* Comparisons of third party software or libraries
* Analyses of library metadata for use with technology
* Project management and communication within the library environment
* Assessment and user studies 
 
C4LJ strives to promote professional communication by minimizing the barriers to publication.  While articles should be of a high quality, they need not follow any formal structure.  Writers should aim for the middle ground between blog posts and articles in traditional refereed journals.  Where appropriate, we encourage authors to submit code samples, algorithms, and pseudo-code. For more information, visit C4LJ's Article Guidelines or browse articles from the first 17 issues published on our website: http://journal.code4lib.org. 
 
Remember, for consideration for the 18th issue, please send proposals, abstracts, or draft articles to journal@code4lib.org no later than Friday, June 29, 2012. 
 
Send in a submission.  Your peers would like to hear what you are doing. 
 
Code4Lib Journal Editorial Committee
