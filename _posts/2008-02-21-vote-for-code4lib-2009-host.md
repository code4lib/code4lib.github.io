We received four very good proposals for hosting the 2009 conference, and now it is time to vote on them!  Voting is open until 3am Eastern Time on Thursday, February 28th.  We expect to announce results at the conference later that day.

3. Click on a host's name to read the proposal in full
4. Assign the proposal a rating from 0 to 3, 0 being least desirable and 3 being the most.
