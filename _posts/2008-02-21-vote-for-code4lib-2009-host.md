We received four very good proposals for hosting the 2009 conference, and now it is time to vote on them!  Voting is open until 3am Eastern Time on Thursday, February 28th.  We expect to announce results at the conference later that day.

2. Log in using your code4lib.org credentials (<a href="/user/register">register</a> for a Drupal account if you haven't done so already and an administrator will approve your account soon thereafter)
3. Click on a host's name to read the proposal in full
4. Assign the proposal a rating from 0 to 3, 0 being least desirable and 3 being the most.
