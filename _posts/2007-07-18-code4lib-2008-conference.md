<h3>Location</h3>

The conference will be held at the <a href="http://embassysuites1.hilton.com/en_US/es/hotel/PDXPSES-Embassy-Suites-Portland-Downtown-Oregon/index.do">Embassy Suites Downtown Portland</a>. A single suite is $150 per night, which includes full breakfast and free happy-hour. To make reservations, please call the hotel directly at (503)279-9000 and let the guest representative know that you are with the 2008 Code4Lib Conference.

Other places to stay: <a href="http://www.markspencer.com/">Mark Spencer Hotel</a> ($89-$169). For cheaper accommodations, some attendees will stay at the <a href="http://www.nwportlandhostel.com/">HI-Portland Hostel, Northwest</a>, $20-$25 per night (dorms), $40-$75 (private rooms), located 1.25 miles away.

<h3>Travel Information</h3>

<b><a href="http://www.flypdx.com/">Portland International Airport (PDX)</a></b>
Public Transit from PDX to the conference hotel:
<ol>
    <li> Board MAX Red Line to City Center & Beaverton TC
    <li> Get off at Oak/ SW 1st Ave MAX Station
    <li>Walk 0.2 mile northwest to Embassy Suites Hotel (319 SW Pine St) -
</ol>
Travel time: 39 minutes (including 5 minutes walking). At $20, the <a href="http://www.trimet.org/7daypass/index.htm">7-Day Pass</a> seems like a good deal, as it would cover both the airport-to-hotel and back trips (via MAX Light Rail), and all public transportation (bus/streetcar/light rail) in and around Portland.  (Single fare: $2.05; daypass: $4.20.) Rides within the downtown area <a href="http://www.trimet.org/fares/fareless.htm">"fareless square"</a> (which includes the hotel) are free. Visit <a href="http://www.trimet.org/index.htm">TriMet</a> for more public transit information.


<b><a href="http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/">Seattle</a></b>: You may also want to look into flights to Seattle and then taking a prop-job down to Portland. Seattle prices were less than half of PDX prices when I (eby) purchased saving even with the prop-job or drive down.
