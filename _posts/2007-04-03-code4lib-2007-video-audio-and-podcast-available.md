Most have been done for some time but if you haven't noticed all presentations and lightning talks should have video up. Presentations also have audio and a podcast. Lightning talks will probably have audio in the nearish future. You can access the media from the pages below:

<b>Update: Looks like I forgot to change quite a few of the audio to CBR instead of VBR for the podcast. As such the Flash player on Odeo will make people sound like chipmunks. It should work fine in iTunes or your player of choice (as long as it's not flash). I'll try to redo the audio as soon as I can.</b>
