As it's not shorts and t-shirt weather, and there seems to be a reasonable number of folks staying at the holiday inn express, it'd be sensible, clever and perhaps even organised of us to arrange to travel together to the conference venue in the mornings.

Would it be possible to meet in the lobby at 8:20?  Or leave notes at the desk?
