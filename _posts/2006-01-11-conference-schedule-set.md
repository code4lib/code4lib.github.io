The Code4Lib <a href="/conference/2006/schedule">Conference Schedule</a> is now available. And what a lineup it is! From "Connecting Everything with unAPI and OPA" to "What Blog Applications Can Teach Us About Library Software Architecture" and many geeky points in-between, this is clearly the library tech fest of the century. Until, that is, we do it all again next year.
