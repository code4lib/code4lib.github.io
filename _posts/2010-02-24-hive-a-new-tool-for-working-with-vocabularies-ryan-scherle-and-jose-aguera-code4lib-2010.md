HIVE is a toolkit that assists users in selecting vocabulary and ontology terms to annotate digital content. HIVE combines the ease of folksonomies with the rigor of traditional vocabularies. By combining semantic web standards with text mining techniques, HIVE will improve the effectiveness of subject metadata generation, allowing users to search and browse terms from a variety of vocabularies and ontologies. Documents can be submitted to HIVE to automatically generate suggested vocabulary terms.

Your system can interact with common vocabularies such as LCSH and MESH via the central HIVE server, or you can install a local copy of HIVE with your own custom set of vocabularies. This talk will give an overview of the current features of HIVE and describe how to build tools that use the HIVE services.
