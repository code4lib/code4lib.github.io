"Two Paths to Interoperable Metadataâ€ [1] proposed a model for metadata
translation that offers substantial gains over models based on the
current community standard, which usually involves an XSLT
implementation. In this presentation, I will discuss implementation
issues with the Semantic Equivalence Expression Language (Seel), our
alternative to XSLT [2]. I will show how Seel eases the complex task of
change management because it represents a more faithful computational
model of the metadata translation problem.
