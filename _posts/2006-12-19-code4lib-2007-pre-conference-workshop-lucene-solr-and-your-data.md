9am - 5pm, Tuesday February 27

<strong>Location Updated</strong>: Because of the overwhelming response, the pre-conference has been moved to the <a href="http://www.uga.edu/campuslife/facilities/tate.html">Tate Student Center</a>, Room 137. 

</p>

<p>
This will be a full day event devoted to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">lucene</a> and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/solr/">solr</a>. 
The event will be led by Erik Hatcher, committer on the Lucene and Solr projects, and co-author of <a href="http://lucenebook.com/">Lucene in Action</a>, and <a href="http://www.manning.com/hatcher/">Java Development with Ant</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The morning will be devoted to background and theory, and the afternoon will be an opportunity to try some hands-on projects. Participants should either bring a wi-fi enabled laptop or be prepared to look over someone else's shoulder. So that we can get as much accomplished in the workshop as possible, we will provide a list of software and documentation to be downloaded before the workshop. If you are interested in working with a specific data set, please bring the data set with you, preferably on a sharable media format (e.g., CDROM, USB Flash Drive) so that we can exchange data sets quickly and easily. To save time at the event, please get your data into XML before the conference. 
</p>
<p>
There is no registration fee to attend the workshop. <strike>However, so that we can plan for adequate space, please register by emailing bess [at] virginia [dot] edu with a simple message that you plan to attend.</strike> <font color="red">Registration is full!</font> Then remember to book your flight a day early and reserve an extra night in the hotel. <font color="red">Also, please join the mailing list for the pre-conference if you want to receive all the communication that will be sent out about it: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/code4libpreconf">http://groups.google.com/group/code4libpreconf</a></font>

<font color="red">ADDED:</font> 
We have over sixty people, and more people are joining all the time. That is a lot of people to handle for a hands on workshop. In order to handle this, we're going to divide into teams based on what language you feel most comfortable using with solr. I'd also like to ask that a couple of people volunteer to be the coordinator of each team. If you're a coordinator, your job is to make sure you have downloaded all the software, you have a good data set to work with, and you've at least run through the tutorial and been able to get some data into solr. Also, you should probably be pretty comfortable with your chosen programming language. You can come here to sign up for a team, and indicate whether you'd be willing to act as a coordinator. The purpose of this is to make sure we know before the event whether we have enough coordinators for each language, and to make sure we don't spend all our time the day of the event trying to form groups.
