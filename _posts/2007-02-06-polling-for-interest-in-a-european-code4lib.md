Following up on discussion over on #code4lib and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/code4libcon">code4libcon</a> Google group, I've <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=522703261251">set up a short survey</a>. The survey polls respondents to see what interest there is in a European event, and to assess whether such an event should be <em>as well as</em> or <em>instead of</em> a North American code4libcon.

Please register your views, and raise awareness of this survey ahead of the closing date, 15 February.

As noted in the survey itself, neither the code4lib community nor <a href="http://tdn.talis.com/">Talis</a> are bound to hold an event at a time or in a place solely on the basis of this survey. The results are <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/Report.asp?U=326125126044">freely available</a>, during and after the survey.

And before anyone asks, the rather odd set of locations are those that arose during the earlier discussions. If you have a preferred place that isn't listed, simply add it as an 'Other'.
