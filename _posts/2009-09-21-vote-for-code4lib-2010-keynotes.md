(Copied from the email sent out by Michael Giarlo earlier today.)

Yo code4lib, it's time to vote for keynote speakers for the code4lib 2010 conference: <a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/index/11">http://vote.code4lib.org/election/index/11</a>

The ballot will stay open through 11:59PM Eastern on Monday, October 5th.

<!--break-->

Next to each of the nominated keynote speakers, you'll find ranks ranging from 0 to 3: 0 indicating no interest in seeing a keynote by the nominee and 3 indicating heavy interest in seeing a keynote by the nominee.  You can change your rankings at any time until the ballot closes.

P.S. You'll need to sign in with your code4lib.org site credentials to vote.  If you do not yet have an account on code4lib.org, go sign up for one!  New accounts require administrator approval and we get tons of spam accounts, so do us a favor and include your full real name, a job-related e-mail address, your website link, or some combination thereof when you sign up for an account.  Otherwise it can be difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.  If your e-mail address ends in @mail.ru, we are likely to pass you over.  Feel free to send me (leftwing@alumni.rutgers.edu) a note if you've signed up for an account and we're slow to approve it; the "request new password" functionality might also be worth a click.
