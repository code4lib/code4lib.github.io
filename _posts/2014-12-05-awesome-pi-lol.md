Inspired by Harvard Library Lab’s “Awesome Box” project, Cornell’s
Library Outside the Library (LOL) group is piloting a more automated
approach to letting our users tell us which materials they find
particularly stunning. Armed with a Raspberry Pi, a barcode scanner, and
some bits of kit that flash and glow, we have ventured into the foreign
world of hardware development. This talk will discuss what it’s like for
software developers and designers to get their hands dirty, how patrons
are reacting to the Awesomizer, and LOL’s not-afraid-to-fail philosophy
of experimentation.
