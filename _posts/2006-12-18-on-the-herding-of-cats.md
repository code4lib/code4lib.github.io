<b>Mike Rylander</b>

At PINES we have the luxury of a very supportive administrative team. Through trial and error over the last three years we have had the chance to glean a set of do's and don'ts for the building of a successful in-house development team and environment. We would like to share our experience in the hope that others may be able to duplicate our successes and avoid our missteps at all levels, from developers on up to management.
