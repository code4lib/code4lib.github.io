Libraries face tremendous challenges to create effective and responsive institutions in a Googlezon world. But the type of leadership we need so far hasnâ€™t materialized. If it isnâ€™t going to come from the administrators, let it come from the coders. In this talk I will build a case for establishing Code4Lib as a nonprofit library software cooperative. A financial structure would allow us to put real resourcesâ€”both financial and humanâ€”into bringing libraries into the 21st century.
