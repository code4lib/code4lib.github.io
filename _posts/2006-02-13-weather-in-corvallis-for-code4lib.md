title: Weather in Corvallis for Code4lib
created: 1139874436
---
For those attending code4lib, Corvallis is going to be a bit cool to cold, depending from where you are from. The forecast calls for highs in the low 40's at tops, and lows in the lower 30's or even upper 20's. The good news is that at the moment, it is supposed to be fairly dry Wednesday through Friday, though expect rain on Tuesday. The bad news is that the rain/dry forcast can quickly change. We do have a shuttle from the hotel to the restaurants / bars for each evening's social time, just in case.
