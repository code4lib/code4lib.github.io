We have 8 pre-conferences for <a rel="swc:isSubEventOf" href="/conference/2009/">code4lib2009</a> -- 2 full day and 6 half day. The plan is to charge a flat $25 pre-conference fee to cover room and break costs. Plan to arrive at morning sessions beginning at 8:30 am, and afternoon sessions beginning at 1.

Two 12-passenger shuttles circling between the Renaissance and Brown will run 7:45-9:45, 11:45-1:45, 4:15-6:15. Some may prefer to walk; allow at least 20 minutes for the 1 mile walk to the John Hay Library, or 30 minutes for the 1.5 miles to the Inn at Brown.  Maps will be available.

        The goals of this full-day workshop are to give participants a firm grounding in a variety of OCLC-provided APIs as well as the protocols upon which they are based (e.g., SRU, CQL). APIs to be highlighted will include the WorldCat Search API, xID services (xISBN, xISSN, and xOCLCNUM), WorldCat Identities, Terminologies, and others. All of these services are free to OCLC cataloging institutions. Besides learning about these services directly from the people involved with building them, you will have time to use them while having the experts in the room to answer questions and assist. You will emerge an expert in using a rich array of library APIs that can be used to enhance your local services. <br />

<h3><strong>Morning Pre-conferences</strong></h3>
<ul>
<a name="xml"></a>
      <li> <strong>XML In Libraries</strong><br />
        XML is about distributing data and information unambiguously. Through this hands-on workshop participants will learn: 1) what XML is, and 2) how it can be used to build library collections and faciliate library services in our globally networked environment. I have given this workshop quite a number of times in other venues, and the complete online version is available at the following URL: <a href="http://infomotions.com/musings/xml-in-libraries/">http://infomotions.com/musings/xml-in-libraries/</a>      <br />
        <strong>Time Slot:</strong> Half Day <br />
        <strong>Location:</strong> John Hay Library, 20 Prospect Street, Bopp Room <br />
        <strong>Attendees:</strong> 20 <br />
        <strong>Organizer:</strong> Eric Lease Morgan, University of Notre Dame, (574) 631-8604, eric.lease.morgan@gmail.com
      </li>

</ul>

<a name="vufind"></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>VuFind</strong><br />
Help for anyone who is interested in installing VuFind.  Time for conversations on developing a stronger community of developers around VuFind and associated projects.<br />
<strong>Time Slot:</strong> Half Day<br />
<strong>Attendees:</strong> 5-?<br />
<strong>Organizers:</strong> Andrew Nagy<br />
<strong>Location:</strong>Vartan Gregorian Quad, 101 Thayer Street, room 116-E<br />
<strong>Presenters:</strong><br />
Andrew Nagy, Serials Solutions<br />
Chris Barr, Villanova University</li>

<a name="koha"></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Koha</strong><br />
We intend to show you how to get the most out of (or into) Koha, open source ILS.  Without attempting to be a comprehensive ILS demo, we will discuss software components used by Koha and how they are applied to problems like searching, internationalization, customization, 3rd party content, automation, etc.  Participants should bring laptops and will receive access to a stock Koha installation for experimentation (if they opt not to use their own).<br /><br />

After seeing how Koha works, you then get to break it, or make it work differently, perhaps better.  The distributed version control Git will be introduced, including how to use it to make a change, generate a patch, and send it for inclusion in the mainline Koha project.  Similarly we will show how to use Git to keep your repositories updated, even when you have local changes.  Koha developers will be on hand to help you get your git on, and otherwise answer the question "How do I make Koha do X?"
<strong>Time Slot:</strong> Half Day<br />

<h3><strong>Afternoon Pre-conferences</strong></h3>

<a name="fedora"></a>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Fedora: a look under the hood</strong><br />
        This half-day workshop will provide an opportunity to examine the inner workings of Fedora 3 and its new Content Model Architecture (CMA). Topics to be covered include ingestion of objects, access policy implementation, internal messaging services, creation of content models and their association to objects, as well as the API-A and API-M interfaces. Dan Davis of the Fedora Commons ( <a href="http://www.fedora.info/">http://www.fedora.info/</a>) will lead this investigation.<br />
        <strong>Time Slot:</strong> Half Day<br />

        <strong>Location:</strong> John Hay Library, Bopp Room<br />

</ul>
<a name="gis"></a>
<ul>
      <li><strong>Build an open-source GIS infrastructure just like Mother used to make!<br />
        </strong>Participants should bring laptops (*nix very much preferred, minimal support for Windows) We'll discuss, build up, and play with a stack of open-source tools that will provide a complete geospatial-data infrastructure, including data and metadata repositories and J2EE service layer (web-tier). Then we'll take our new gear out for a spin by building first a simple online mapping application and then a more complex webapp which combines geospatial and bibliographic data. <br />
        <strong>Time Slot:</strong> Half Day<br />
