In case you haven't seen the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/code4lib%40listserv.nd.edu/msg03905.html">discussion</a> on the code4lib list, the New England chapter of code4lib is pulling itself up from its own bootstraps. They're self-organizing using a <a href="http://ne.code4lib.org">wiki</a> and are currently <a href="http://dilettantes.code4lib.org/voting_booth/election/index/5">voting on a venue</a> for the first meeting. 

If you are interested in starting your own local chapter, check out (and make better) the new <a href="http://code4lib.org/local">code4lib local</a> page.
