The Code4Lib Community is calling for proposals to host the tenth annual Code4Lib Conference in 2015. Prior to submitting a proposal we recommend reviewing the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/hosting">conference hosting web page</a> and <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/How_To_Plan_A_Code4LibCon">How To Plan a Code4LibCon</a> on the wiki to learn more about the kind of venue the community seeks and the responsibilities involved with hosting the conference.

The deadline for proposals is <strong>midnight PST Wednesday March 12th, 2014.</strong> The decision will be made by a popular vote. Voting will begin on or around Friday March 14th, 2014 and will continue until midnight PST March 26th, 2014. The results of the vote will be announced Thursday morning at the Code4Lib conference 2014 and emailed out to the listserv.

You can apply by making your pitch to the Code4Lib Conference Planning list at code4libcon@googlegroups.com and linking to your proposal on <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/2015_Hosting_Proposals">the 2015 Hosting Proposals wiki page</a>; attention to the criteria listed on the conference hosting page is appreciated. Good luck!
