Princeton University has developed their current digital collections architecture around a native XML database and the XQuery programming language. This presentation will look at XQuery's strengths and weaknesses within the context of our current development environment as well as mention other environments in which an XQuery framework would (or, perhaps, wouldn't) work. What is XQuery? Why would one want to use it? Doesn't it do the same thing as XSLT? How does fulltext searching work within, or in conjunction with, XQuery? and Will XQuery be flexible enough to adjust to changes in our backend system? are all questions that will be posed and discussed.
