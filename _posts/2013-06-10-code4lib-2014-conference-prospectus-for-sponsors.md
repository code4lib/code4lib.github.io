title: Code4Lib 2014 Conference Prospectus for Sponsors
created: 1370884629
---
The Code4Lib 2014 Sponsorship Committee has put together a prospectus for potential sponsors (see attached file). This full-color PDF file describes the conference, lists representative past speakers, provides quotes from attendees, and lists all of the sponsorship opportunities and their attached benefits to sponsors.

If you wish to contact a potential sponsor, please <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Code4Lib_2014_Conference_Planning_Volunteers#Sponsorships_Committee">contact the committee</a> before doing so to prevent multiple contacts of the same sponsor.

This is the first time that such a brochure has been created in support of obtaining conference sponsorships, so the 2014 crew gets major kudos for stepping up our game this year. Tim McGeary of UNC Chapel Hill is the committee chair.
