Have you started experimenting with Git on your own, but now you need to
include others in your projects? Learn from our mistakes! Transitioning
from a one-person git workflow and repo structure, to a structure that
includes multiple people (including student workers), is not for the
faint of heart. We'll talk about why we decided to work this way, our
path to developing a git culture amongst ourselves, conceptual and
technical difficulties we've faced, what we learned, and where we are
now. Also with pretty pictures (aka workflow drawings).
