Ever since Ed Summers (edsu) created the LinkedIn group for Code4Lib, requests to join have been flooding in. We're now at 210 members, but it hasn't shown many signs of slowing down yet. I try to get to the requests to join on a regular basis, but with vacation and all if you don't get accepted right away feel free to send me an email.
