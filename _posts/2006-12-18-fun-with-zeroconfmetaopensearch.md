<b>Dan Chudnov</b>

What if we could share our libraries like we can share music in iTunes? Maybe we can. Maybe a little ZeroConf and OpenSearch added to existing library systems like metasearch and service resolvers can help make it happen faster, easier, and cheaper than you might think. Or two of those, at least.

[Update, post-conference] the slides and audio from the talk are <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/story/zeroconf-meta-opensearch-code4lib-talk-wrap-up">available here</a>.

<b>The man behind the camera apologizes as video was accidentally not taken of this talk (he was watching Dan instead.) He has since combined the audio and slides and <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/code4lib.conf.2007.pres.ZeroConfMetaOpenSearch">uploaded it to archive.org</a>:</b>
