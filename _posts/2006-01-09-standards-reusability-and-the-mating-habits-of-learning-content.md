  libraries are supposed to foster reuse of digital content but it is hard to combine
  content from different sources. We are building prototype software that (1) converts
  different types of courseware to an XML interchange format based on OpenDocument
  and other specs/standards (2) enables the content to be disaggregated, recombined,
  re-styled and endowed with SCORM reporting behaviors and (3) realizes instructional
  design through the use of the SCORM (or IMS) Simple Sequencing. Will demo, discuss
  and am happy to talk about the bigger picture of reusability in educational digital
  libraries and standards if given a longer slot.\r"
