<b>Casey Durfee</b> - LibraryThing<br />
I will discuss MARCThing, a self-contained web service which aims to do for MARC and Z39.50 what Solr did for searching. MARCThing can run off a thumb drive, but is powerful enough to handle the needs of a large site like LibraryThing.com. It was designed to free developers from the complexity of MARC and Z39.50 and their idiosyncrasies in the real world.
