Esmé Cowles, UC San Diego Library. 

<ul>
<li>One repository contains untold numbers of digital objects and powers many Hydra and Islandora apps
It speaks RDF, but contains no triplestore! (triplestores sold separately, SPARQL Update may be involved, some restrictions apply)</li>
<li>Flexible enough to tie itself in knots implementing storage and access control policies</li>
<li>Witness feats of strength and scalability, with dramatically increased performance and clustering</li>
<li>Plumb the depths of bottomless hierarchies, and marvel at the metadata woven into the very fabric of the repository</li>
<li>Ponder the paradox of ingesting large files by not ingesting them</li>
<li>Be amazed as Fedora 4 swallows other systems whole (including Fedora 3 repositories)</li>
<li>Watch novice developers setup Fedora 4 from scratch, with just a handful of incantations to Git and Maven</li>
</ul>
The Fedora Commons Repository is the foundation of many digital collections, e-research, digital library, archives, digital preservation, institutional repository and open access publishing systems. This talk will focus on how Fedora 4 improves core repository functionality, adds new features, maintains backwards compatibility, and addresses the shortcomings of Fedora 3.
