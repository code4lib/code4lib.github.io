I will articulate a framework that I am using to teach LIS students how to remix information with XML and web services. Because information remix comes across as a grab bag of techniques, students need a framework for learning a particular example of remix in depth so they can understand remixing in a broader context. In my talk, I will reflect on using Flickr as a paradigmatic example in elucidating remix to LIS students.
