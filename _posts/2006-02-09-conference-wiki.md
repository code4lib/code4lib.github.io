Jeremy has set up a <a href="http://wiki.library.oregonstate.edu/confluence/display/code4lib/Home">wiki</a> where you can sign up for lightning talks and add/edit breakout session ideas. Yeah, there is a page here at code4lib.org too, but we've copied over the existing entries from there. The wiki should be more flexible for collaboration once the conference starts.
