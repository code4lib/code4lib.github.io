On Wednesday and Thursday there are 1 hour 15 minute slots for <i>Lightning Talks</i>. A lightning talk is a fast paced 5 minute talk on the topic of your choosing. If you'd like to do a lightning talk please add your name, topic to this page.

Mark Jason Dominus has a nice <a href="http://perl.plover.com/lt/lightning-talks.html">page</a> about lightning talks, which includes this summary of why you might want to do one:

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you've never given a talk before, and you'd like to start small. For a Lightning Talk, you don't need to make slides, and if you do decide to make slides, you only need to make three.</p>

<p>Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be over quickly.</p>

<p>Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question, or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about something you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a lot of things to say, and you're already going to give a long talk on one of them, and you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks. Hey, they're only five minutes.</p>
