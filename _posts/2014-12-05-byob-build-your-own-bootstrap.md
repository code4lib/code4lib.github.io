Bootstrap is awesome! It allows for quick and easy front-end development
without demanding too much time with the design of the user interface. A
framework like Bootstrap can also help libraries address one of our top
usability problems: wild inconsistency of styles and layouts across our
own in-house applications and websites.

However, what if you do not want to compromise your creativity and make
your project visually stand out? With enough Sass or Less knowledge it
is possible to highly customize Bootstrap to fit your needs, but in the
end you still end up with your design and code buying into Bootstrap's
markup and design conventions, which are not always what you want.
Sometimes you simply want to start with a clean slate and not fight the
framework and use only the components and features you need.

In that case, build your own Bootstrap! In this talk we will discuss
techniques for using some of the emerging tools from the front-end
development and design communities to create a maintainable, modular
in-house Sass toolkit that we are implementing within a variety of tools
including Drupal, Rails applications, in house PHP applications, as well
as within vendor solutions like Libguides and ILLiad. Some specific
tools we will discuss are Grunt, Bower, and Sass tools like Singularity,
Breakpoint, and Bourbon.
