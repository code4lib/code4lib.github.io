[<strong>Update</strong> (2006-03-16): the new home for unAPI and this spec is <a href="http://unapi.info/">unapi.info</a>.]

Attached is revision 1 of unAPI.  Revision 2 is due in one month.

unAPI has changed significantly since version 0.  A combination of many sharp minds from various nations and healthy skepticism and a variety of scrumptious Oregon microbrews on tap nearby has narrowed its scoped and tightened its approach significantly.

There are still a number of issues to consider but revision 1 is a solid spec that should be easily implemented in a variety of contexts.  If you wish to comment, complain, commend, or suggest other tasty Oregon microbrews we might sample before we leave Corvallis please recall that the <a href="http://cipolo.med.yale.edu/mailman/listinfo/gcs-pcs-list">gcs-pcs-list</a> is the list of record for unAPI development.

My apologies for the release of the spec being seven minutes past deadline PST.
