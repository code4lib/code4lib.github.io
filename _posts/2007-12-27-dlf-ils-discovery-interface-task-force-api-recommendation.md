The DLF ILS Discovery Interface Task Force was charged with creating a technical proposal that would provide standardized integration between integrated library systems and external applications, better enabling libraries to replace their OPAC with an external discovery system. This talk would provide background for the project and an overview of the recommendation (hopefully published by code4lib 2008), as well as address how the library developer community can contribute to API implementation. More information and current work on the recommendation are available: https://project.library.upenn.edu/confluence/display/ilsapi/Home. A breakout session could facilitate further feedback and discussion of next steps.
