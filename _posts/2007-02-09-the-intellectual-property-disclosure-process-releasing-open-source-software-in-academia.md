This presentation will cover the copyright issues and pitfalls that arise when a locally created software application is being considered for release under an open-source license.  It will be based on the knowledge and experience gained shepherding two applications through the intellectual property disclosure process at the University of Texas at Arlington, so that the applications could be officially released as open source.
