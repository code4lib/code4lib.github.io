**TALK HAS BEEN CANCELLED**

Refinery is an open source web platform for the analysis of large
unstructured document collections. It extracts meaningful semantic
themes within documents also known as "topics" which can be thought of
as word clouds composed of terms that highly co-occur with one another.
Once this semantic index is formed, one can extract relevant documents
related to these topics and further refine their contents through a
summarization process that allows users to search for phrases that are
relevant to them within the corpus. The goal of Refinery is to make this
whole process easier and to provide some of the latest scalable versions
of these learning algorithms in an intuitive web-based interface.
Refinery is also meant to be run locally, thus bypassing the need for
securing document collections over the internet. The talk will go
through some of the technologies involved and a demo of the app.
