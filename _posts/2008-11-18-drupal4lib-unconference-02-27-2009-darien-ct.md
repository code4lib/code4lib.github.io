<p>Darien Library will be hosting a <a href="http://drupalib.interoperating.info/drupal4libcamp">Drupal4Lib Camp</a> on Friday, February 27, 2009 from 9 am to 4 pm. It just so happens this is the day after <a href="http://code4lib.org/2009">code4lib2009</a> ends in nearby Providence, RI -- so you can theoretically hop on over after code4lib proper ends.</p>

<p>The camp will be an opportunity for libraries who are working with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, or interested in implementing Drupal, to get together, share experiences, solve problems, and collaborate. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> will be a combination of a series of 10 min lightning talks given by Drupal veterans in the morning followed by break-out sessions in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Audio and video from Drupal4Lib Camp sessions will also be streamed lived online. There is no registration fee. However, participation is limited to 70.  Please <a href="http://drupalib.interoperating.info/node/167">register</a> for the Drupal4Lib Camp.</p>
