(first-time presenter)

So you want to expose your digital content in your discovery interface,
integrated with the data from your ILS? How do you make the best
information user searchable? How do you present complete, up to date
search results with a minimum of duplicate entries?

At Stanford, we have these cases and more:

- digital content with no metadata in ILS
- digital content for metadata in ILS
- digital content with its own metadata derived from ILS metadata.

We will describe our efforts to accommodate multiple updatable metadata
sources for materials in the ILS and our Digital Object Repository while
presenting users with reduced duplication in SearchWorks. Included will
be some failures, some successes, and an honest assessment of where we
are now.
