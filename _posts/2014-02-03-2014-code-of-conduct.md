Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, fun, and safe community and conference experience and ongoing community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery
(including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of  talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>

1. Initial Incident

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please inform the offender that he/she has affected you negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having that initial discussion.

2. Escalation 

If the offender insists that he/she did not offend, or if offender is actively harassing you, then you will need a third party to step in.

If you are at a conference or other event, find the event organizer or staff person. For #c4l14, that would be <b>Tim McGeary</b>. <i>If you can't find the event organizer, please notify the CONCENTRA staff at the Registration Desk to help if the situation calls for immediate action.</i>

If you are logged into the <a href="http://code4lib.org/irc">#code4lib IRC channel</a>, the command <b>@helpers</b> can be entered which will cause the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Zoia_or_the_Code4Lib_IRC_bot">zoia robot</a> to list people designated as channel helpers. There should be at least one helper in the channel most times.

For the listserv, you have a free-for-all for public messages; however, the listserv does have a maintainer, <b>Eric Lease Morgan</b>.

3. Wider community response to Incident:

If the incident doesn't pass the first step (discussion reveals offense was unintentional, apologies said, public note or community is informed of resolution), then there's not much the community can do at this point since the incident was resolved without outside intervention.

If incident results in corrective action, the community should support the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action, like ending a talk early or banning from the listserv, as well as support those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the Help should come to the community with these issues and the community should revise the CoC as they see fit.

In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced. People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will say that it didn't go far enough. We really can't stop people having opinions, but what we could do here is have constructive discussions that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC, modify decision, etc,), instead of reproducing the comments section of a story on a news site.

<h3>Sanctions</h3>

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom or mailing list.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Code4lib events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

<i>Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges</i>, and will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified by issuing the `@helpers` command in the #code4lib IRC channel (see above).
