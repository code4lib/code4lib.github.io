We want to introduce you to a new group convening in the NYC area: Code4LibNYC.  

We are aspiring to start a local version of the Code4lib national organization. We want to provide a forum where library technologists can share information about library technology and discuss their current projects.  Our group is open to all library staff interested in the coding, deployment, and design of library software, systems, and web services. 

This local chapter of Code4Lib, known as Code4LibNYC, aspires to channel the spirit of the national organization. We want to provide a forum for software and web developers and programmers, working at libraries, to discuss their ongoing projects. We focus on development issues surrounding the following types of library services and tools: content management systems, web application frameworks, digital library systems, institutional repositories, subject repositories, federated search tools, and next generation OPACs. We look at the protocols and programming tools that power these types of applications. Many of our members have a strong interest in open source software. Group membership includes systems librarians, web services librarians, digital library developers, digital library managers, and systems-inclined library staff.  Please see METRO's page for additional information at <a href="http://www.metro.org/collaborate/index.php/Code4libNYC">http://www.metro.org/collaborate/index.php/Code4libNYC</a>.

We hope you can attend our first meeting at the METRO offices (<a href="http://www.metro.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20&Itemid=228">directions</a>) on East 11th street from 10 a.m. - 12:00 noon on Wednesday, September 10th.    

Please contact us us if you are interested in attending or have questions about this new group. 
 * Kevin Reiss (KReiss@gc.cuny.edu)
 * Paul Albert (paa2013@med.cornell.edu)
 * Joanna DiPasquale (jd2481@columbia.edu)

Additionally, we will keep Code4Lib updated about the group, including more mundane things like scheduling and meeting formats.  (We hope that we can share these experiences so that other local Code4Lib groups can benefit -- and are looking forward to hearing from those groups, too.)
