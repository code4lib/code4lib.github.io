The [Code4Lib 2016](http://2016.code4lib.org) Philadelphia Committee is pleased to announce that we have finalized the dates and location of the [2016 conference](http://2016.code4lib.org).

The 2016 conference will be held from March 7 through March 10 in the Old City District of Philadelphia.  This location puts conference attendees within easy walking distance of many of Philadelphia’s historical treasures, including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Constitution Center, and the house where Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence. Attendees will also be a very short distance from the Delaware River waterfront and will be a short walk from numerous excellent restaurants.

As we’ll be reserving almost all of the space within the hotel for our conference (both rooms and conference spaces), Code4Lib 2016 will have the tight-knit community feel we know is important.

More details to come soon; in the meantime, the Keynote Committee is gearing up to open submissions for the conference keynote speaker, so be sure to contact them at [pacella@gmail.com](mailto:pacella@gmail.com) for more information, or you can nominate a keynote speaker at [http://wiki.code4lib.org/2016_Invited_Speakers_Nominations](http://wiki.code4lib.org/2016_Invited_Speakers_Nominations).  

Also, our Sponsorship Committee is actively looking for sponsors for 2016, so please contact the committee via [Shaun Ellis](mailto:shaune@princeton.edu) to learn about all the ways your organization can help sponsor our 2016 conference.

It’s shaping up to be a great conference this year, and there will be lots more opportunities to volunteer. Our team is looking forward to seeing you on March 7!

The Code4Lib 2016 Philadelphia Committee
