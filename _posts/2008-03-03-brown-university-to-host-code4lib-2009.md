created: 1204571656

By now pretty much everyone knows (since it was announced at Code4Lib 2008), but in the interest of the historical record, let it show that Brown University will be hosting Code4Lib 2009. They submitted the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/code4libcon/browse_thread/thread/d0e92993b8fc5b21">winning proposal</a> that will bring all library coders who can make it to Providence, Rhode Island in February 2009. We hope to see you there!
