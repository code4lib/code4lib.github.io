We are seeking sponsors to offset childcare costs, but for now, you should plan for $200/child/day for a 0-2 year old and $100 for a 3+ year old.

**Travel to Portland**

Portland International Airport (PDX) has direct flights throughout the US and Canada, as well as Japan. Portland's light rail system (MAX) runs from the airport to a few blocks from the conference hotel every 15 minutes between 5 am and 11:30 pm daily for $2.50.

During other hours, or for those who prefer to travel directly to the hotel, there is a [shuttle](http://www.bluestarbus.com/downtown-shuttle-schedule.php) that travels directly to the Hilton for $14 one-way or $24 round trip. The shuttle can be booked in advance, but it's not necessary during many hours.

Portland is an easy city to get around, with small blocks designed for walkability. MAX, streetcar, and buses make it easy to travel from downtown to other parts of the city.

**Video Archive**
Thanks to a team of volunteers, the conference was streamed and archived. The archive is available on the [Code4Lib YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/code4lib/videos).
