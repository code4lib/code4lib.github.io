</ul>
</dd>

<dt><strong>Types of Activites and Programs</strong></dt>
<dd>
<ul>

<li><em>Keynotes</em> - 45 minutes, talks from the farthernmost reaches of library software development where significant real work is getting done. To provide an opportunity to see where they are up close, to learn details of their implementation choices, to hear about the challenges they're facing and how those might scale/translate to the rest of us.</li>

<li><em>Prepared talks</em> - 20 minutes, which must center on "tools" (some kick-ass new software library or integration platform), "specs" (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or "challenges" (Some Big Problem  we should collectively address). We will evaluate proposals on criteria of geekiness, usefulness, newness, and diversity of topics.</li>

<li><em>Lightning talks</em>  - 5 minutes, those interested sign up on a wiki that opens at the start of the conference.  *Hard* 5 minute limit... at 4 minutes the next person gets up and starts attaching their screen, and somebody keeps a hard count.</li>

<li><em><a href="http://wiki.library.oregonstate.edu/confluence/display/code4lib/Breakout+Session+Ideas">Breakouts</a></em> - People interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together for 60-90 minute blocks. Somebody near to the project/problem can coordinate discussion, set up hackers, tackle a challenge session topic, etc. Larger groups will get separate space, smaller groups can just spread out in the larger conference room space.</li>

</ul>
