A few people decided to fix the existing bugs in the solr python client and release it with unit tests, and some more documentation...and make it available via the <a href="http://python.org/pypi/solrpy">Cheeseshop</a>. To support this the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/solrpy">solrpy</a> Google Code project was created. There probably won't be tons of changes but if you use python and solr together you might be interested in using it, and subscribing to the discussion list.
