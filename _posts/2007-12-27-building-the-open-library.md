<b>Aaron Swartz</b> - Tech Lead, Open Library<br />
The Open Library project (demo.openlibrary.org) is a collaboration between publishers, libraries, booklovers, and technologists to create a wiki with a page for every book. So far, we've been parsing Library of Congress records, ONIX feeds, Amazon pages, and more. And all the code and data used along the way is completely open. We'll discuss the project's goals, what we've built so far, and how you can help.
