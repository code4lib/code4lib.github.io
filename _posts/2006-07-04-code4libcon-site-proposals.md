<dt>Arlington, Texas</dt>
<dd>Proposed by Michael Doran</dd>
<dd>UT Arlington has a lot going for it as a conference venue. Prime location: For those not familiar with Arlington, Texas, we are located smack dab in middle of the Dallas/Fort Worth “Metroplex”...In the interest of full disclosure, let me say that the good transportation news is that it is easy to get to Arlington, but the bad news is that it is hard to get around Arlington if you don’t have a car. Although Arlington has a population of about 300,000, there is no public transportation here. (There is public transportation in Dallas and Fort Worth and train service between the two.) Related to the local Arlington lack-of-public-transportation problem is the fact that there are no accommodations directly on campus, and probably no acceptable accommodations within walking distance, so some type of shuttle service would have to be arranged.</dd>
