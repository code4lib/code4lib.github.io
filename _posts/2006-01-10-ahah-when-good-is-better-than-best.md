It can be difficult to enhance, fix or extend legacy/closed-source web applications such as online catalogs without being able to alter the web application directly.

I will discuss using AHAH (Asynchronous HTTPRequest and HTML) as a technique for doing so and compare it to AJAX, proxying and SSI. Examples from the Seattle Public Libraryâ€™s next generation online catalog will be presented. Performance and scalability concerns will also be covered, time permitting.
