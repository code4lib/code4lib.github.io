Josh Wilson, Systems Integration Librarian, State Library of North Carolina

At the State Library of North Carolina, we had more specific questions about the use of our digital collections than standard GA could provide. A few implementations of custom events and custom variables later, we have our answers.

I'll demonstrate how these analytics add-ons work, and why implementation can sometimes be more complicated than just adding a few lines of JavaScript to your ga.js. I'll discuss some specific examples in use at the SLNC:

<ul>
    <li>Capturing the content of specific metadata fields in CONTENTdm as Custom Events</li>
    <li>Recording Drupal taxonomy terms as Custom Variables</li>
</ul>

In both instances, this data deepened our understanding of how our sites and collections were being used, and in turn, we were able to report usage more accurately to content contributors and other stakeholders.
