  want a session to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the <a href=\"http://code4lib.org/conference/2008/schedule\">order
  of talks</a> and who you hope will attend.  There are at least five rooms available
  each day, including the large meeting room, and we will route different proposed
  sessions to the different rooms depending on a quick show-of-hands survey just before
  each one begins.\r\n\r"

Anyone can propose a breakout session - please think about whether you would want a session to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2008/schedule">order of talks</a> and who you hope will attend.  There are at least five rooms available each day, including the large meeting room, and we will route different proposed sessions to the different rooms depending on a quick show-of-hands survey just before each one begins.

This page will list any sessions proposed before the conference itself, but there will also be flip charts outside the meeting room where more sessions can be proposed.
