Oslo Public Library has converted the entire MARC-catalogue to RDF via the self-made conversion tool MARC2RDF.

<a href="http://data.deichman.no">data.deichman.no</a>, the enriched RDF version of the library catalogue including its authority files, forms the basis for two different mashups; The Active shelf and the Book recommendation database. The RDF catalogue is linked with various content and the dataset is updated daily to account for additions, deletions and changes made in the MARC catalogue.

<a href="http://vimeo.com/68687814%7C">The Active shelf</a> is a physical touchscreen device that makes use of open source software, RFID technology, RDF data and external web service APIs to provide information about any library book a patron is curious to know more about.

The Book recommendations database stores book recommendations written by library staff from all over Norway and links them to the RDF-representation of the MARC-catalogue.
