New managers are often promoted without receiving management training,
yet management is not something you just figure out. The experience of
being expected to know how to manage, yet not being trained to do so
often results in new managers feeling isolated and unsure how to move
from making to managing. In this talk Iâ€™ll focus on my own managerial
experience of designing and leading an archival tech team in a small
independent archives. Topics covered will include hiring, delegating,
creating a team culture, and leading people whose specialized knowledge
exceeds your own. The talk take-aways should be applicable to managers
and employees at large and small institutions alike.
