A logo design process Working Group has been formed, with me, Ranti Junus and Emily Molanphy. To help us keep track of our process and to allow interested community members to track our work, I have created a <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Logo_Design_Process">wiki page</a> that will serve as an ongoing record of progress. <a href="mailto:roytennant@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you have any questions.
