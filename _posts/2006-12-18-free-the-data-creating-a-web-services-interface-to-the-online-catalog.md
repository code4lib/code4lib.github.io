<b>Emily Lynema</b>

NCSU Libraries’ initial implementation of its Endeca-powered catalog did little to utilize increased flexibility to create more interoperability.

This talk would discuss current work to enable integration by creating a web services platform on top of the catalog. Examples include a web service supplying local availability for ISBN REST requests, an RSS layer for all catalog search/browse activities, and OpenSearch integration with the library website’s Quick Search (including experimentation with facet data in OpenSearch).
