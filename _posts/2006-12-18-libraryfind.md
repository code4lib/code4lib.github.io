<b>Terry Reese</b>

Over the past 1/2 year, Oregon State University (OSU) Libraries have been actively developing a hybrid federated search service called LibraryFind. We believe that our approach is unique in a number of ways (knowledge-base management, caching, OpenURL integration). OSU believes LibraryFind has something to contribute to the library community, and I’d like to show attendees what LibraryFind is, some things we learned through usability studies and how they can get the software and start playing.
