If you wish to host a Code4Lib Conference in your community, please review this information before applying. The Code4Lib Conference occurs in or near February each year, to provide a complement to the <a href="http://access2010.lib.umanitoba.ca/">Access Conference</a>.

<strong>Requirements of a Hosting Site</strong>
<ul>
<!--li>A North American location (for the "main" conference in February, overseas locations will be considered for additional events).</li-->
<li>A host (usually a committee) willing to make local arrangements and coordinate with the site. Many colleges and universities have conference planning assistance.</li>
<li>An auditorium or similar space suitable for the conference itself (capacities in recent years have been 400-450), and room for 8-12 pre-conference workshops "breakout" groups (30-50), which may be a combination of the main space and smaller rooms. Note that while a keynote may be held in an auditorium, it is preferable for the main conference day to have tables and chairs for seating. </li>
<li>Wireless network available to attendees free or sponsored by the conference</li>
<li>A commitment to work with the conference planning group to help keep attendee costs to a minimum. Past costs have been about $120-200 including meals for 3 days. This requires substantial sponsorship from outside institutions and the hosting institution.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Additional Desirable Qualities</strong>

<ul>
<li>Small college or university town (why? "amenities", my friend, amenities). Conferences are also often held in large cities.</li>
<li>Reasonably near a major airport (we are prepared to interpret this liberally if the other qualifications are strong)</li>
<li>Some distance away from the last conference site, all things being equal (to spread the travel pain)</li>
<li>Pre-conference day/events, preferably with optional separate registration</li>
</ul>

<strong>What the Hosting Site is Responsible For</strong>

<ul>
<li>Since there is no legal Code4Lib entity, the hosting site must provide a fiscal sponsor for signing any necessary contracts for space or hotel rental. From a legal point of view, the sponsor is putting on the conference with Code4Lib branding. This institution is responsible for gathering sponsorship and registration funds and then transferring them to next year's host. The hosting site may choose to contract with other entities as necessary to fulfill these responsibilities.</li>
<li>Managing the program planning process (scheduling and arranging the presentation application and voting process, etc.)  Prior years have used a voting mechanism tied to the Code4Lib website (e.g., <a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/">this</a>); the same system may be used for subsequent conferences.</li>
<li>Arranging evening networking opportunities (e.g., interesting and/or good restaurants and bars and/or events)</li>
<li>Leading the effort to sign on conference sponsors (various members of the community are expected to volunteer to help sign up sponsors</li>
</ul>

<strong>What the Conference Planning Groups are Responsible For</strong>

<p>These items are the responsibility of the Code4Lib Conference planning group (anyone on the conference planning list, which is open to anyone), but the conference host is often actively involved with these aspects as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Participating in garnering conference sponsors</li>
<li>Assisting with conference planning tasks</li>
</ul>
