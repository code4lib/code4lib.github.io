<b>Joan Starr</b>

Academic digital libraries face serious challenges in trying to adopt agile project management techniques. While there have always been significant differences between how an academic and a corporate team might solve a problem, today, digital library and corporate offerings are often in direct competition. Time-to-market is more important than ever before. This talk will identify the most troublesome characteristics of academic bureaucracies and make suggestions for working around these obstacles.
