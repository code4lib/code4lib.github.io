<p><em>Building a library IM bot.</em><br /> As suggested by Ed Vielmetti, it would be handy to provide bots that patrons can add as buddies to their AIM, MSN, or Yahoo IM accounts. Features might include:
<ul>
<li>catalogue searching</li>
<li>library hours</li>
<li>my account information (at least display it, and maybe renew books too?)</li>
<li>contact information for circ desks, liaison librarians etc.</li>
<li>forward a reference question to a librarian IM account</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developing unAPI and w/unAPI</em><br />
Discuss open issues on the spec and prepare a revision for release on 2/16 (day 2 of code4lib).  Also a good time to learn more about what it can do for you, and to try implementing it, too! -dchud</p>

<em>Developing an Interface for Federated Search engines or for an OPAC interface</em><br />

<p><em>More Lipstick on a Pig: Improving OPACs</em><br />
Share ideas for ways to improve OPACs either by hacking/adding services/integrating services with vendor supplied OPACs or by exporting the data and presenting it in a custom app.
