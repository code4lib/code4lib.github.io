(my first code4lib post)

<a href="http://inkdroid.org">Ed Summers</a> and <a href="http://rubybrain.org/">William Groppe</a> have jumped in head-strong to crafting a Ruby DSL to Solr.  <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/solrb">solrb</a> is coming along nicely thanks to our collaborations.

Another early adopter asked a question on the solr-user e-mail list, and I replied with a lot of  <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Faceted-search-problem-tf3025078.html">juicy tidbits</a> to whet your appetite.

We're moving as fast as we can in order to use this infrastructure for the basis of <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Flare">Solr Flare</a>, destined to be faceted browsing plugins for Rails allowing your Rails application to easily benefit from what Solr and solrb offer.  Solr Flare will debut at the code4lib <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2007/lucenesolr/">pre-conference event</a> in whatever form it happens to be in by then.

If you're a Rubyist who loves the goodness of Lucene and/or Ferret, you'll love Solr.  We aim for solrb and Flare to be the Ruby way to Solr's heart.

And especially tasty for the code4lib crowd is the Solr importer that is <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/solr/trunk/client/ruby/solrb/examples/marc/marc_importer.rb">under way</a>.

Hungry yet?  I've got a stone, anyone got any carrots?
