 <strong>Ask Anything!</strong>
<br>
Wherein you ask...anything, a.k.a. "Human Search Engine". A chance for you to ask a roomful of code4libbers anything that's on your mind: questions seeking answers (short or long), requests for things (hardware, software, skills, or help), or offers of things. We'll keep the pace fast, and the answers faster.
<br>Come with questions and line up at the start of the session and we'll go through as many as we can; sometimes we'll stop at finding the right person or people to answer a query and it'll be up to you to find each other after the session.  If you don't ask questions, you get a stand-up routine, and poorly told jokes. (No pirates this year...)
