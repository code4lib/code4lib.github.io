title: Code4Lib Downtime

The server on which code4lib.org lives will be moving this week.  I haven't set up an exact time yet, but there will be some downtime as it is moved to a new host.  It may be Monday afternoon or perhaps Wed. or Thurs. (I'm hoping for Mon. afternoon).  Details, when known, will be posted here and on the mailing list and IRC channel.

<em>Update:</em> Looks like Wed. will be the day for server migration.
