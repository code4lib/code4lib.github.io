<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://roytennant.com/JohnHaylibrary.jpg"><img width="300" height="225" src="http://roytennant.com/JohnHaylibrary_s.jpg" border="0" align="right" /></a>The goals of this full-day workshop are to give participants a firm grounding in a variety of OCLC-provided APIs as well as the protocols upon which they are based (e.g., SRU, CQL). APIs to be highlighted will include the WorldCat Search API, xID services (xISBN, xISSN, and xOCLCNUM), WorldCat Identities, Terminologies, and others. All of these services are free to OCLC cataloging institutions. Besides learning about these services directly from the people involved with building them, you will have time to use them while having the experts in the room to answer questions and assist. You will emerge an expert in using a rich array of library APIs that can be used to enhance your local services. </p>
