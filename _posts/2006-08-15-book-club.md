So a bunch of us in #code4lib are thinking of starting up a book club to read tech books together, learn from each other in the process, and hopefully use a bit of peer pressure to propel ourselves into actually finishing a book. 

The first book we're proposing we read is <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> which is available in print and also online. Lisp and functional languages in general are enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, so we figured this might be a good one to start with. It's also very, umm, practical--building working code to parse ID3 tags (metadata!) and the like.

Should we create a google group or something? Any suggested name for the group? Is there really any need to limit our membership to people in libraries? How about books4code?


Interested? Suggestions? Bueller? Feel free to tack comments on here.

<em>Update:</em> A <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/books4code">Google Group</a> and a <a href="http://books.code4lib.org">wiki</a> have been created</a>.
