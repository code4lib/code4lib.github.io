title: Code4Lib 2009 Breakout Sessions
created: 1233166632
---
Those interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together for 70 minute blocks. Generally the person who suggests the topic will take on the role as moderator to begin and moderate the discussion. Anyone can propose a breakout session - please think about whether you would want a session to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2009/schedule">order of talks</a> and who you hope will attend. There are five rooms available each day, including the large meeting room, and we will route different proposed sessions to the different rooms depending on a quick show-of-hands survey just before each one begins.

This page will list any sessions proposed before the conference itself, but there will also be flip charts outside the meeting room where more sessions can be proposed.
