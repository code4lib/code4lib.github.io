[Creating Tomorrowâ€™s Technologists: Contrasting Information Technology Curriculum in North American Library and Information Science Graduate Programs against Code4lib Job Listings](http://monicamaceli.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Maceli_JELIS_2015.pdf) by [Monica Maceli](http://monicamaceli.com/) recently appeared in the *Journal of Education for Library and Information Science* 56.3 (DOI:10.12783/issn.2328-2967/56/3/3). As the title states, it studies listings on [jobs.code4lib.org](http://jobs.code4lib.org/):

> This research study explores technology-related course offerings in ALA-accredited library and information science (LIS) graduate programs in North America. These data are juxtaposed against a text analysis of several thousand LIS-specific technology job listings from the Code4lib jobs website. Starting in 2003, as a popular library technology mailing list, Code4lib has since expanded to an annual conference in the United States and a job-posting website. The study found that database and web design/development topics continued to dominate course offerings with diverse sub-topics covered. Strong growth was noted in the area of user experience but a lack of related jobs for librarians  was  identified.  Analysis  of  the  job  listings  revealed  common  technology-centric librarian and non-librarian job titles, as well as frequently correlated requirements for technology skillsets relating to the popular foci of web design/development and metadata. Finally, this study presents a series of suggestions for LIS educators in order that they continue to keep curriculum aligned with current technology employment requirements.
