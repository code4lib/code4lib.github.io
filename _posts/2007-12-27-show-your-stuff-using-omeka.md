Libraries need a simple solution for sharing and publishing collections on the web. Omeka can help. Open source, robust, and easy to install, Omeka gives cultural and academic institutions the means to publish archived content into beautiful, customizable web sites and exhibits. We'll show you how Omeka works, and how to extend it with plugins and custom themes. Finally, we'll explore the possibilities for migrating and publishing existing collections from other management systems using Omeka.
