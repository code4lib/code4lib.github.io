<p>Taking a <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/story/dear-code4lib-you-look-good-in-xhtml">cue </a> from <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/">dchud</a> the #code4lib irc channel is now being <a href="/irc-logs">logged</a>. To view the logs you *must* be logged in to code4lib.org. You can prefix any message you want with: ! and your message *will not* be logged. Try it out. I think this is a reasonable compromise that works well in <a href="http://swhack.com/">other</a> online communities with an irc component.</p>

<p>The logging is done by bartleby who is a <a href="http://rbach.priv.at/Patches/LogBot-20051116.diff">patched</a> and modified (the ! functionality) version of <a href="http://www.jibble.org/logbot/">LogBot</a>. This is a work in progress as always, and a community effort so please share your ideas thoughts about this....and take a look at the shiny XHTML source for your favorite xml parser to chew on.</p>
