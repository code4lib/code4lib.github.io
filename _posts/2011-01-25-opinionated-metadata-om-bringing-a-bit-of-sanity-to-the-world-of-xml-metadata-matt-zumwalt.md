<strong>Opinionated Metadata (OM): Bringing a Bit of Sanity to the World of XML Metadata</strong>

<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/om">Opinionated Metadata</a> (OM) grew from discussions at Code4Lib 2010. It's now an integral component in the <a href="http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/The+Hydra+Framework+and+its+Parts">Hydra Framework</a>. Unlike most XML solutions, which start from schemas and build outwards, OM allows you to start from the natural vocabulary that emerges in user stories. Based on the terms that show up in those user stories, you can use OM to create a Terminology that maps each term to nodes in schema-driven XML. This Terminology then serves as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for your code to rely on.
