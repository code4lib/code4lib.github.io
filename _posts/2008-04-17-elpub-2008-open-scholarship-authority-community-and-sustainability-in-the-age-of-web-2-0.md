We look forward to welcoming you to Toronto this June!

About ELPUB 2008:
Scholarly communications, and in particular scholarly publications, are
undergoing tremendous changes. Researchers, universities, funding bodies, research libraries and publishers are responding in different ways, from active experimentation with new models and adaptation of existing practices, to strong resistance or rejection of new communication methods. ELPUB 2008 will focus on a number of key issues surrounding the future of scholarly communications that arise as a result of the intersection of semantic web technologies, the development of cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and the sciences, and new dissemination channels and business models.

The three-day event will begin with a full day of technical workshops. The following two days will feature contributed papers examining a broad range of technical, conceptual, policy, and financial aspects of scholarly communication. Poster presentations and demonstrations of new publishing and research tools will form part of the program. A plenary session on funding and access policies for publicly funded research, and a special session on open access developments in transitional and developing countries will round out the program. The conference will begin and end with special keynotes by John Willinsky and Stevan Harnad.

The final agenda for the conference will be available online in late March,after the peer-review of submitted papers has been completed and acceptances have been confirmed.
