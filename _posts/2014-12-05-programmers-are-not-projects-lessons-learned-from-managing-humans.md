first-time presenter

Managing projects is one thing, but managing people is another. Whether
we’re hired as managers or grow “organically” into management roles,
sometimes technical people end up leading technical teams (gasp!). I’ll
talk about lessons I’ve learned about hiring, retaining, and working
long-term and day-to-day with highly tech-competent humans. I’ll also
talk about navigating the politics of libraryland, juggling different
types of projects, and working with constrained budgets to make good
things and keep talented people engaged.
