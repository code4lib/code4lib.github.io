<a href="/conference/2010/schedule">Code4Lib 2010</a> - Wednesday, February 24 - 11:15-12:00

a.k.a. "Human Search Engine". A chance for you to ask a roomful of code4libbers anything that's on your mind: questions seeking answers (short or long), requests for things (hardware, software, skills, or help), or offers of things. We'll keep the pace fast, and the answers faster. Come with questions and line up at the start of the session and we'll go through as many as we can; sometimes we'll stop at finding the right person or people to answer a query and it'll be up to you to find each other after the session. First time at code4libcon! (Thanks to Ka-Ping Yee for the inspiration/explanation, reused here in part.)
