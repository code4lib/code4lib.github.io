Thanks to Ross Singer, the Diebold 2K13 machine was rebooted for votes at <a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/23">Keynote speaker votes</a>.

Since the meeting is in Chicago next year we expect you to vote early
and vote often. Voting will stop when we cats and dog votes beat those
of humans and robots.
