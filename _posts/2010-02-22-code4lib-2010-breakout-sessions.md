excerpt: Those interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together
  for 70 minute blocks. Generally the person who suggests the topic will take on the
  role as moderator to begin and moderate the discussion. Anyone can propose a breakout
  session - please think about whether you would want a session to be held on Tuesday
  or Wednesday, depending on the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2010/schedule">order
  of talks</a> and who you hope will attend.

Those interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together for 70 minute blocks. Generally the person who suggests the topic will take on the role as moderator to begin and moderate the discussion. Anyone can propose a breakout session - please think about whether you would want a session to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2010/schedule">order of talks</a> and who you hope will attend. There are a lot of rooms available each day, including the large meeting room, and we will route different proposed sessions to the different rooms depending on a quick show-of-hands survey just before each one begins.
