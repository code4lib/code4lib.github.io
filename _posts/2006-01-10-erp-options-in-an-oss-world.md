Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications are considered some of the largest and most complex systems ever written, and support many of the functions that libraries associate with the acquisitions and processing side of their operations. The information retrieval layers of library systems receive a lot of attention with good reason, but thereâ€™s also a body of standards and best practices for back office systems which libraries could benefit from as well. Open Source ERP systems offer options for libraries to take advantage of OMG standards and workflow engines, and this session will give an overview of some currently available ERP options.
