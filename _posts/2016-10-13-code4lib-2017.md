The 2017 conference will be held from March 6 through March 9 in the at the <a href="http://luskinconferencecenter.ucla.edu/">Luskin Conference Center</a> at UCLA. With a very large and modern conference center at our disposal, Code4Lib 2017 will be able to accommodate the growing number of attendees while also retaining that small, tight-knit Code4Lib community feeling of previous years. We hope you can come join us!

More information about this year's conference is available on the  <a href="http://2017.code4lib.org">2017 conference</a> website.

Itâ€™s shaping up to be a great conference this year, and there will be lots more opportunities to volunteer. Our team is looking forward to seeing you on March 6!
