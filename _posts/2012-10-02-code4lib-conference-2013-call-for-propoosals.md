We are now accepting proposals for Code4lib 2013.

Code4lib 2013 is a loosely-structured conference for library technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge collaborations. The conference will be held Monday February 11th (Preconference Day) - Thursday February 14th, 2013 in Chicago, IL. More information can be found on the <a href="http://tigger.uic.edu/~kayiwa/code4lib.html">host committee information page</a>. 

Head over to the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/2013_talks_proposals">call for proposals page on the Code4Lib Wiki</a> and submit your idea for a prepared talk for this year's conference! Proposals should be no longer than 500 words, and preferably many less.
<!--break-->
Prepared talks are 20 minutes (including setup and questions), and focus on one or more of the following areas:

<ul>
	<li>tools (some cool new software, software library or integration platform)</li>
	<li>specs (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones)</li>
	<li>challenges (one or more big problems we should collectively address)</li>
</ul>

The community will vote on proposals using the criteria of:
<ul>
	<li>usefulness</li>
	<li>newness</li>
	<li>geekiness</li>
	<li>uniqueness</li>
	<li>awesomeness</li>
</ul>

Proposals can be submitted through Friday, November 2nd, 5pm PT.  Voting will commence soon thereafter. The submitter (and if necessary a second presenter) will be guaranteed an opportunity to register for the conference.

<a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/2013_preconference_proposals">Proposals for preconferences</a> are also open until November 2nd, 5pm PT. 

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk and breakout sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with an opportunity to do so.

Looking forward to seeing your proposals!
