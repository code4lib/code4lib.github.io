<b>Rob Styles</b> - Programme Manager, Talis<br />

I've been doing a lot of work around extracting as much meaning as possible from Marc records, using RDF as the data structure. Marc is a record-centric format, the result is anything but, with the RDF allowing rich relationships to form in the data that can then be used to drive different navigation techniques. This is about making the most of what is in Marc data to do something new.
