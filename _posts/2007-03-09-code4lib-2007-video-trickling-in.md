As anyone who has encoded video knows, it can be a slow process. If you happen to be in IRC be sure to thank ecorrado and npeden for their work on the videos. The videos are slowly being uploaded to code4lib. As space needs to be shuffled a little bit on Anvil I've taken the liberty of mirroring the videos at Michigan State and also uploading them to Google to make them easier to embed.

The files that have been processed <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=label%3A%22code4lib2007%22">are tagged with code4lib2007 on Google</a>. I've also included a link to download the MPEG-4 file and embedded the video for watching <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007/schedule">on the presentation pages</a>. You'll need a player that can handle MPEG-4 (H.264) and AAC audio to view the downloaded files. The latest Quicktime should work, as well as VLC and MPlayer. If you compiled either yourself, be sure to include mp4 and aac support.

It may be awhile before all the videos are up. Once they are I'll probably work on getting pod/vodcasts up.

<strong>Update</strong>: I'm also dumping the audio from the videos to mp3 for those who would prefer just the audio for portability. A podcast will be forthcoming. The mp3's are linked from the presentation pages.
