<strong>Richard Wallis</strong>, Talis

Solr enabled great innovation and prompted even more. But they are still just OPACs. Users want much more than a library catalogue alone can provide. This presentation shares some of the experience, code, and techniques used to embed a multiplicity of extension points in to an OPAC interface in a consistent way that can be built upon by others. From author videos to LibraryThing Common Knowledge by way of an audio page reader and beyond.
