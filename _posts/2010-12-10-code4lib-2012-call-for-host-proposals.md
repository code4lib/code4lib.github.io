The deadline for proposals is Sunday January 23, 2011. The

popular vote.  Voting will begin on or around Wednesday January 25,
2011 and will continue through the first three days of Code4Lib 2011 until
11:59PM Eastern on Wednesday, February 9th. The results of the vote will be
announced on Thursday, February 10th, the final day of Code4Lib 2011.
