<b>Dr. Jonathon Richter</b> - University of Oregon<br />

Second Life is web-enabled via XML-RPC and HTTP so that it can automatically export data out from
scripted 3D objects and import in from Web databases. Its hackability is under-reported in favor of tales about naked avatars and case studies of failed ad campaigns but we think this platform may be useful for hybrid 3D modules for ILS systems. Two mashup projects will be interesting to library coders:
<ul>
<li> Sloodle.org connects Moodle to 3D learning tools</li>
<li> the Salamander project is organizing a 3D learning objects taxonomy related to Merlot.org (http://tinyurl.com/2pvqp9).</li>
</ul>
The two founders will describe their projects and give tips for hacking SL.
