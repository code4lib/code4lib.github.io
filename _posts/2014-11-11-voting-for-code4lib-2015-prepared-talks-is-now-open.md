The Code4Lib 2015 Program Committee is happy to announce that voting is now open for prepared talks.
 
To vote, visit [http://vote.code4lib.org/election/33](http://vote.code4lib.org/election/33), review the proposals, and assign points to those presentations you would like to see on the program this year.
 
You will need to log in with your code4lib.org account in order to vote. If you have any issues with your account, please contact Ryan Wick at ryanwick@gmail.com.
 
*Voting will end on Tuesday, November 25, 2014 at 11:59:59 PM PT (GMT-8).*
 
The top 10 proposals are guaranteed a slot at the conference. The Program Committee will curate the remainder of the program in an effort to ensure diversity in program content and presenters. Community votes will still weigh heavily in these decisions.

The final list of presentations will be announced in early- to mid-December.
