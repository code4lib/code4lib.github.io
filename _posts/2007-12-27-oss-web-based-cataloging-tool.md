<b>Chris Catalfo</b> - Programmer, LibLime<br />

This presentation introduces a new open source, web-based cataloging application, started for the 2007 Google Summer of Code and currently developed at LibLime. It provides a full featured, customizable, fast application for original and copy cataloging. It uses the ExtJS user interface toolkit, Google Gears for local storage of bibliographic records, PazPar2 for searching multiple Z39.50 servers, and it will feature an integrated Jabber client for exchanging records.
