There was a session at code4lib 2006 on using IM bots to deliver library services.  I was at a different session, but I thought about it a bit and realized that the "jake-like" queries to the CUFTS database could fairly easily be adapted to the IM world.  "jake-like" queries being "where is this journal indexed?", "where is there fulltext for this journal and what's the coverage", etc.  I started on a quick bot while I was there, got that working and finished up a fairly comprehensive version last week.

Connecting the bot to the IM network was very easy thanks to Net::OSCAR.  Unfortunately, it doesn't include file transfers, but everything else I wanted was there.  Since I already had the database and queries mostly written, the bulk of the work was formatting the results for IM size display, handling "more" commands, and writing help.

So, you can now add "CUFTS2" as a contact on AOL/AIM/ICQ (they're all on the OSCAR network) and send it queries.  Here's an example transcript.

> help

This bot is used to search the CUFTS journals database for information on where journals are indexed, available in fulltext, and what the coverage periods are.
"help commands" will give a list of valid commands.
Example Usage:
