Faceted navigation, which is an increasingly common feature of library OPACS, was initially developed to browse hierarchical data. MARC data however, has relatively little hierarchy, and user-generated tags have even less. The flatness of this data, makes the navigation of search result-sets cumbersome and often ineffective. BiblioCommons has been tracking academic research and industry best-practices in this realm, and experimenting with different methods of adding structure to these datasets. This session will share learning to date.
