We are now accepting proposals for prepared talks for Code4lib 2008. Code4lib 2008 is a loosely structured conference for library technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the Access HackFest, wrapped into a conference-like format. It is *the* event for technologists building digital libraries and digital information systems, tools, and software.
<!--break-->

The conference will be held February 25-28, 2008 in Portland Oregon. More information can be found at <http://code4lib.org/conference/2008>.

Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must focus on one or more of the following areas:
- "tools" (some cool new software, software library or integration platform)
- "specs" (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones)
- "challenges" (one or more big problems we should collectively address).

The community will vote on proposals using the criteria of:
- usefulness
- newness
- geekiness
- diversity of topics.

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with an opportunity to do so.

Please send your name, email address, and proposal of no more than 75 words to code4libcon at googlegroups.com. The proposal deadline is November 30, 2007, and proposers will be notified by December 14, 2007.
