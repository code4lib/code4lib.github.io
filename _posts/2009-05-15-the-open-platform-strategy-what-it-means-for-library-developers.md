<strong>Edward M. Corrado</strong>, Binghamton University

Ex Libris has announced an Open Platform Strategy. As part of this approach they will supply well-documented “Open-APIs” and Web services. They have also created EL Commons, a collaborative Web-based platform that includes a Developer Zone and a code-sharing platform for customers. OCLC also has an Open-API approach with the WorldCat Grid. This presentation will investigate what this Open-API strategy means for customers and why (or why not) libraries should support this “open”-proprietary strategy.
