<b>Edward Corrado</b> - TCNJ<br />

Code4lib is a successful brand in the library world, but with its continued growth it is time to consider the future of Code4Lib. This presentation will discuss options Code4lib has for the future, including becoming a non-profit 501(3)c corporation, joining with another organization, or keeping everything as it is. The implications of forming an organizational structure will be discussed and ample time will be giving to solicit input from conference attendees.
