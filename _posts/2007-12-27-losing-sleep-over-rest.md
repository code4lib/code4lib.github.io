We've recently hacked an API for the NYPL Digital Gallery to share images with the video collaboration platform, Kaltura. This could be your library's dream, or nightmare, depending where you sit. Is there a sweet spot between offering lightweight APIs - with possibly limited reliability - vs. trying to develop a bullet-proof API? Is the possible solution to seed the API to interested parties through feeds, with the implied expectation that it's a work in progress?
