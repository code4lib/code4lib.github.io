<strong>Kevin S. Clarke</strong>, Appalachian State University; <strong>John Fereira</strong>, Cornell University

What kind of dummy would volunteer to do a presentation on a product he hasn't even tried before? Perhaps the kind that has three weeks off from work in Dec./Jan. Or, perhaps the kind that hopes others will join him in this radical experiment. I'm very interested in learning more about djatoka so propose to share what I learn over the next two months in a twenty minute presentation.
