The ad hoc Code4Lib Logo committee (Ranti Junus, Emily Molanphy and Roy Tennant) is pleased to announce the new Code4Lib logo designed by Stephanie Brinley of <a href="http://www.adeliedesign.com/">Adelie Design</a>. The <a href="/logo/">logo web page</a> links to all the various derivatives and versions, as well as guidelines for use. Those who are curious about the process can read about it at the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Logo_Design_Process">logo design process</a> page.
