The Scholarship Committee is pleased to announce the Code4Lib 2014 Conference Diversity Scholarship awardees. Through the generosity of CLIR/DLF, EBSCO, ProQuest, and Sumana Harihareswara, we were able to award nine $1,000 scholarships to defray costs associated with attending the conference. We received a large number of applications from highly qualified candidates this year, and it was a humbling experience for the committee to select just nine awardees. Congratulations to all Code4Lib scholarship recipients!
