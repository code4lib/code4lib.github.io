<h4>Hotel</h4>

The Sheraton Raleigh Hotel is working through a $6 million renovation that will be completed this fall.  Upon your arrival, you will find a warm and open lobby, great for informal meetups and relaxing. In the hotel will be <a href="http://www.sheratonraleigh.com/raleigh-restaurant">Jimmy V's restaurant</a>, where 5% of the revenues are donated to the V Foundation for Cancer Research.  The hotel is always within easy walking distance to many restaurants, pubs, parks, museums, and other attractions.

The Code4Lib 2014 Conference will be the only event using the meeting space that week.  The meeting space offers open foyers that will be excellent for the morning and afternoon breaks, along with space for the project and vendor table sponsors looking to build collaboration with the Code4Lib community.

Finally, the hotel has the capacity to host all of the attendees, and we've negotiated a rate of $159/night that includes wireless access in the hotel rooms.  Hotel reservations will be able to be made after you register using the information provided in your registration confirmation. To guarantee receiving the conference rate, reservations must be made by Monday, February 24th.

Parking is available in a deck adjacent to the Sheraton for $12/day.
