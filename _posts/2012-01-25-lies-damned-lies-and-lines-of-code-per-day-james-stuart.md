We've all heard about that one study that showed that Pair Programming was 20% efficient than working alone. Or maybe you saw on a blog that study that showed that programmers who write fewer lines of code per day are more efficient...or was it less efficient? And of course, we all know that programmers who work in (Ruby|Python|Java|C|Erlang) have been shown to be more efficient.

<p>
A quick examination of some of the research surrounding programming efficiency and methodology, with a focus on personal productivity, and how to incorporate the more believable research into your own team's workflow.
