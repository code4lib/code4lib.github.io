This presentation will discuss how librarians, developers, and system
administrators at Georgetown University are maximizing their use of the
public and private GitHub repositories.

In additional to all of the great benefits of using Git for code
management, the GitHub interface provides a powerful set of tools to
showcase a project and to keep your users informed of developments to
your project. These tools can assist with marketing and outreach -
turning your code repository into a focus of conversation!
