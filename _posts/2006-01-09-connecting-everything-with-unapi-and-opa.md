unAPI is a simple-to-use, simple-to-implement API for web sites that allows rich object access and can be easily layered over existing services like Atom, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH, or SRU. OPA is a general-purpose identifier resolver that wraps API calls to heavily-used but incompatible web services like those from Amazon, Flickr, and Pubmed.

Together they will do the same thing we do every code4libcon â€“ try to take over the world!
