The video from Day 1 for Code4Lib 2007 has been uploaded for downloading and on Google Video. This includes all lightning talks. You can view or download from the presentation pages accessible from the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2007/schedule">conference schedule</a>.

If you want a version for your ipod or PSP then you should be able to download a version from Google Video. Embedding is also enabled. Feel free to rate or tag the videos. Podcasts will be forthcoming once the other days are done.

If you notice any problems with the videos please let us know. I was uploading and linking them rather quickly so I would not be surprised if there is a mixup or two. I'm on channel or just comment here. Again thanks goes to Noel Peden (npeden) for doing the heavy lifting of editing and encoding.

<b>Update</b>: Both Day 2 and Day 3 are now uploaded and linked to on the Presentation and Lightning Talk pages. Please let us know if you notice anything wrong. Google is still churning through the files.
