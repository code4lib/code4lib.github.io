<strong>Birkin James Diana</strong>, Brown University

How to monitor, in near-real-time, usage of all the great services we build and offer? Often stats-production isn't built-in to our services, and when it is, the lack of standard output makes centralized monitoring difficult. Brown's Library is experimenting with a valued corporate solution, building standardized stats output and trend visualization for new and existing projects -- and centrally exposing this info. This talk will cover our dashboard/widget implementation.
